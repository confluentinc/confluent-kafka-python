Confluent Kafka AIOProducer Module

This module contains all the components for the async Kafka producer:

Core Components:
- AIOProducer: Main async producer with clean architecture
- ProducerBatchProcessor: Message batching and organization
- KafkaBatchExecutor: Kafka operations and thread pool management
- BufferTimeoutManager: Timeout monitoring and automatic flushing

Data Structures:
- MessageBatch: Immutable value object for batch data

Architecture Benefits:
✅ Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
✅ Clean Interfaces: Well-defined boundaries between components
✅ Immutable Data: MessageBatch objects prevent accidental mutations
✅ Better Testing: Components can be tested independently
✅ Maintainable: Clear separation makes changes safer
