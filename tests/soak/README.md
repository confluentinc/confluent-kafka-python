# Soak testing client

The soak testing clients should be run for prolonged periods
of time, typically 2+ weeks, to vet out any resource leaks, etc.

The soak testing client is made up of a producer, producing messages to
the configured topic, and a consumer, consuming the same messages back.

OpenTelemetry reporting supported through OTLP.
